#TURNING THE BELOW INTO A PARAGRAPH
# There are many models
# out there describing
# how successful change typically
# unfolds in organizations.
# Some models have six,
# seven, even eight stages
# of steps that instruct
# managers on how best
# to introduce and manage change.
# But the majority of successful
# change initiatives-- adaptive,
# transformational, or
# a hybrid of the two--
# can really be broken
# down into three stages,
# with each of these
# stages depicting
# groups of activities aimed at
# achieving a few critical goals.
# For managers, these
# goals are first,
# getting the organization
# ready for change,
# second, implementing
# changes, and third,
# making changes stick.
# Let's discuss each of
# these stages in turn.
# The first stage of
# most change processes
# involves preparing
# the organization
# and its employees for change.
# For managers, this
# stage is mainly
# about helping employees
# recognize the need for change
# and raising awareness
# of the problems facing
# the organization.
# It also involves taking steps
# to ensure that employees will
# get on board and
# be ready to proceed
# with new ways of
# thinking and acting.
# Whether they're small or large,
# change initiatives typically
# begin when leaders
# or other employees
# realize that the firm's
# current ways of doing business
# are suboptimal and
# can be improved.
# Maybe the current product
# development process
# is too slow, or customer
# service is poor.
# Whatever the situation,
# for managers, this period
# is usually one of questioning
# current ways of doing business,
# setting goals for
# performance in the future,
# and designing realistic changes
# that employees can carry out.
# There are many names
# for this first stage--
# taking charge, setting the
# stage, and a number of others.
# The psychologist, Kurt Lewin,
# had a vivid and fitting name
# for it.
# He called it "unfreezing".
# Here's the idea.
# At the start of
# a change process,
# the firm and its
# employees are frozen
# in the current ways of
# operating, many of which
# are often dysfunctional or
# problematic for the future.
# Leaders have to, therefore,
# unfreeze" the organization.
# They have to take a
# metaphorical torch
# or chisel to an
# organization that's
# hardened in the ways of
# working so that it can adapt
# to the new demands it faces.
# How do managers do it?
